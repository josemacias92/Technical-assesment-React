Gitmefy is a web App that allows to review any public repositories of a given user in GitHub.

To start using it, just intruduce a GitHub username on the box and its repositories will be loaded.

Then, you will be able to see the first repository of the given user and its issues will be automatically listed.

You can switch to any repository by using the drowdown menu, and if there are a large amount of repositories, you can navigate throught them using the pages displayed on the top.

Now just navigate throught your issues list, where you will identify the pull requests by the two merging branches symbol.

You can list all the issues by using the pagination placed at the bottom.

And if you want to know further details of any issue, just click it and a modal will show more details plus its list of comments.
